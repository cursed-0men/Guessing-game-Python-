# Guessing-game-Python
This Python script implements a simple number guessing game. 
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it within the given range.

# Usage
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. Based on the guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess is too small or too large.
4. The player continues to guess until the correct number is found.

# Sample Output
guess a number(b/w 1-10) = 5
guess is small, enter a larger number
guess a number(b/w 1-10) = 8
guess is large, enter a smaller number
guess a number(b/w 1-10) = 7
BINGO!!! - Correct guess
